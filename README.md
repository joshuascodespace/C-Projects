# C-Projects
This repository contains projects completed by me that illustrates my C experience.

I did not write set-up code myself; it was provided to me. I did write the body of main.c functions that called matrix.c functions, as well as the matrix.c functions itself. For any other file, aside from the ".h" files, I coded about half of the functions present myself.
